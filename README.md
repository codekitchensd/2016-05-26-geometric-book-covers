This class is inspired by Rune Madsen's [class]() at NYU-ITP.

# Today's Exercise

We'll be using Rune.js to replicate geometric book cover designs.   

Today, we'll learn how to:
-Analyze the components of a successful design
-Break a design into its key components (color, shape, pattern)
-Build a function that creates a programmatic design
-Integrate randomization into a program

## Introduction to Rune.js

[Rune.js](http://runemadsen.github.io/rune.js/) is a Javascript library for creating graphic design systems.  Rune's library has a lot of excellent support for designers and includes support for color, typography, and grid systems.
