// Include pictures

This class is inspired by Rune Madsen's [class]() at NYU-ITP.

# Today's Exercise

We'll be using Rune.js to replicate geometric book cover designs.   

Today, we'll learn how to:
-Analyze the components of a successful design
-Break a design into its key components (color, shape, pattern)
-Build a function that creates a programmatic design
-Integrate randomization into a program
